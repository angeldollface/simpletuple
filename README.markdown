*Handle tuples of N dimensions! :abacus:*

## About :books:

If you know maths and Python, you know that in both there exists a data type called a tuple.
I wanted to write a library that handles tuples of dimension `n`. This is that library.

## Installation :inbox_tray:

### Adding to your project

To add *Simple Tuple* to your project's dependencies, add this line to your project's `pubspec.yaml`:

```YAML
depdencies:
  ...
  simpletuple:
    git: git://github.com/angeldollface/simpletuple.git
```

The three dots represent anything else that you might have in the `dependencies` section. Having done that, re-fetch your project's dependencies by running this in the project's root directory:

```bash
$ dart pub get
```

## Usage :hammer:

### Importing

Import the API like this:

```dart
import 'package:simpletuple/simpletuple.dart';
```

### APIs

To inspect the available APIs, read the source code, please. I've split everything by subject so it should be easy to understand.
